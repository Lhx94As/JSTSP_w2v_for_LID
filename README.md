Before running the training scripts, pls download asv-subtools and move the folder "subtool" to your kaldi/esg/  
Pls also download s3prl and run the pre_processing.py in s3prl.

An example:
>python train_xsa.py --json xsa_config.json

Before running, pls revise the json configuration file according to your own root.  
Mainly the "Input" part, you can keep others since they are the parameters I am using :)
